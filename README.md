# Snake
This program use only python turtle to develop the snake game as my computer laboratory homework. 
You use Up, Down, Left and Right to control the snake to eat the food and dodge the monster. If you press "space", the game will stop. If you press it again, it will continue.
If you have any question or suggestions regarding this program, you could contact me at lynncchen-@hotmail.com. If you like this program, please give me the star :)
